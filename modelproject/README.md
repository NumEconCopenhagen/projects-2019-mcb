# Modelproject

In this project we model an **intertemporal household optimization problem**, where we define a utility function in which a household or individual seeks to maximize his or her utility in a two-period scenario given an endowment of leisure. The model is based on discrete time. For reference one might look at Romer, D., "Advanced Macroeconomics", *McGraw Hill, 4th Edition*, 2012.


Specifically, we model the trade-off between leisure and consumption and derive the optimal consumption smoothing path based on given parameter values of risk aversion, preference for leisure and the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. 
In our project we also consider the effects of changes in the parameters and present figures for each parameter. 
We consider examples of a single- and two-period model and derive the optimal bundle of consumption and leisure.

In the project we use the module MatPlotLib.

You can in install the module this way:

    write this in the Terminal:
    pip install https://github.com/matplotlib/mpl_finance/archive/master.zip

    And this:
    conda install -c anaconda pandas-datareader
