The purpose of this project is to gather stock data from the S&P500 using Yahoo's native API,
and consolidate it into a single CSV-file. From there we create a chart comparing one of the companies from S&P500
to the S&P500 benchmark. We chose 2000/01/01 arbitrarily as our start date with a dynamic end date (last closing date).


During the process we decided to cut out the interactive widget due to time restraints.
For the final hand-in we aim to include interactive options, e.g. comparing multiple companies across GICS sectors
from flexible start and end dates. 

Another idea we had was to make a relative strength index for each stock, but could not find a way to make this work, with the
time constraint we faced.
